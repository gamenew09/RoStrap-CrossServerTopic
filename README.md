# CrossServerTopic
CrossServerTopic is an object module that allows for handling messages sent and recieved by the newly introduced MessagingService. CrossServerTopic isn't just a OOP wrapper of the MessagingService, it seperates the message and time sent in the Subscription Event and allows for deteriming if the message that was recieved was from the local server or from a remote server without you doing anything.

The API reference for this module is inside of the [CrossServerTopic.lua](src/CrossServerTopic.lua) file as a comment at the top.
